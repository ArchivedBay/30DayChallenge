# TO DO #
### general
 - add .wav files to a 'sounds' directory
### /js/app.js ###
 - update app.js to implement these sounds
 - sounds should:
   - play on a ```keydown``` event
   - stop when you let off the key
   
 ### Notes ###
 This should be pretty easy to implement, most of the work was already done when I implemented the 'press' effects.
 Basically I just need to add the sound files & make an additional line that associates each sound with its proper key.
